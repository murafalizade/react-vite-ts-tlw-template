# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Multi Language + Authentication

## Project Overview

This project is built using Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It includes features such as routing, route authorization, 404 page, API fetch strategy, multilanguage support, and Redux implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Integration
Building and Running with Docker
If you prefer to use Docker for building and running the project, follow these steps:

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t your-image-name .
````
Replace your-image-name with a suitable name for your Docker image.

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 your-image-name
````
The -p 3000:3000 flag maps port 3000 from the container to port 3000 on your host machine. Adjust this if your application runs on a different port.

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the running application.
